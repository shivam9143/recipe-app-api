I know about this problem. After add ssh key, add you ssh key to ssh agent too (from official docs)
ssh-agent -s
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
After it all work fine, git can view proper key, before couldn't.


docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "python manage.py test";  

docker volume prune   

docker system prune --volumes

docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

docker-compose up          

docker volume prune          



If, when you start your Docker Compose, you're getting:
PostgreSQL Database directory appears to contain a database; Skipping initialization
you need to proactively remove the volumes which were set up to store the database.
The command docker-compose down doesn't do this automatically.
You can request removal of volumes like this:
docker-compose down --volumes
